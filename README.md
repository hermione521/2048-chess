# 2048-chess
Based on [gabrielecirulli's 2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) and [emils' 2048-multiplayer](https://github.com/EmilS/2048-multiplayerâ€Ž).

It's a multiplayer version that players make one move one time like playing chess. It's also a lab on *Advanced Web* class which is not that advanced.

There's not an online version yet, but we'll figure it out later if not busy.
